# Travelling_Website

This project is a network application to build a web application that is used as a simple travelling website based on the client/server architecture. The website allows the users to lookup several travelling destinations. Users should be allowed to create an account, add places to their “want-to-go list” and search for travelling destinations. The website should initially be hosted on your PC’s “local host”
